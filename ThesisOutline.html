<li>Introduction

<ol>
<li>Motivation (cornea, phenotype control, increase backscatter)

<ol>
<li>Corneal disease big, bad (get stats)</li>
<li>Want to grow artifical corneas</li>
<li>Use patient&#8217;s own cells to prevent immunorejection</li>
<li>Corneal made of collagen; electrospun collagen bad</li>
<li>Use corneal cells to reenact dev. bio; relay collagen in nice transparent form</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t see cells inside collagen&#8211;collagen scatters too highly</li>
<li>Want to see cells by increasing their scattering intensity far past that of the collagen</li>
<li>Do that by immunospecifically binding gold to cells</li>
<li>Specifically, use the alpha5-beta1-integrin surface protein in the myofibroblast (wound healing) phenotype, as most of the transplanted cells will in that phenotype</li>
<li>a5b1-integrin is the attachment point for intercellular matrix fibronectins, connects to intracellular actin filaments</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What kind of gold do we use? (Coates thesis)

<ol>
<li>Solid gold sphere (as opposed to gold shell on different core)

<ol>
<li>Gives best scattering to absorption cross sectional coefficients</li>
<li>Also avoids a specific plasmon resonance changing the spectral scattering profile, resulting in poor coherence gating.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>90 nm diameter

<ol>
<li>Mediates between increased scattering and decreased time in solution (give number and graph)</li>
<li>Also keeps particles small enough to be absorbed through cell membranes</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Failure of van der waals, move to PEG (Rob)

<ol>
<li>Up to Spring 2009, antibodies (AP326F) were simply mixed with Au nanoparticles, but this produced unsatisfactory specificity</li>
<li>Rob found Jen West&#8217;s paper on immunolabeling with PEG; we adapted and began to use it (FA09&#8211;SP10)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Lack of specificity or stability; Ellis/Hoidn for pH and 5 kDa; NHS

<ol>
<li>Unfortunately, the PEGylated spheres produced similarly dismal results. Therefore, over summer 2010, Perry Ellis and Oliver Hoidn investigated the system.

<ol>
<li>pH and salt needed to be maintained</li>
<li>our PEG-SH was too small to properly protect the gold, and especially necessary given the salts</li>
<li>concerns about NHS</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Creation of current protocol

<ol>
<li>5 kDa PEG-SH titration curve to find plateau at 50k PS/Au</li>
<li>5 kDa PEG-SH protection studies: monolayer (50k PS/Au) gives perfectly stable particles</li>
<li>Modification of Ellis/Hoidn protocol to include 5 kDa PEG-SH</li>
<li>Volume control (Alanna&#8217;s pipette measurements) &#8212; everything over 5 ÂµL</li>
<li>Reference to Appendix containing protocol</li>
</ol></li>
<li>DLS results with protocol

<ol>
<li>AP124F results: proper increase with Ab, small increase from PS then hold steady</li>
<li>AP124, MAB1999 results: note that they are puzzling; perhaps future work will bring clarity?</li>
<li>In vitro binding studies go here, if we get to them?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Monolayer Labeling Study</li>
<li>3D culture study</li>
</ol>
