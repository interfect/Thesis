1.	Introduction
	1.	Motivation (cornea, phenotype control, increase backscatter)
		1. Corneal disease big, bad (get stats)
		2. Want to grow artifical corneas
		3. Use patient's own cells to prevent immunorejection
		4. Corneal made of collagen; electrospun collagen bad
		5. Use corneal cells to reenact dev. bio; relay collagen in nice transparent form
		6. Can't see cells inside collagen--collagen scatters too highly
		7. Want to see cells by increasing their scattering intensity far past that of the collagen
		8. Do that by immunospecifically binding gold to cells 
		9. Specifically, use the alpha5-beta1-integrin surface protein in the myofibroblast (wound healing) phenotype, as most of the transplanted cells will in that phenotype
		10. a5b1-integrin is the attachment point for intercellular matrix fibronectins, connects to intracellular actin filaments
	2.	What kind of gold do we use? (Coates thesis)
		1. Solid gold sphere (as opposed to gold shell on different core)
			1. Gives best scattering to absorption cross sectional coefficients
			2. Also avoids a specific plasmon resonance changing the spectral scattering profile, resulting in poor coherence gating.
		2. 90 nm diameter
			1. Mediates between increased scattering and decreased time in solution (give number and graph)
			2. Also keeps particles small enough to be absorbed through cell membranes
	3.	Failure of van der waals, move to PEG (Rob)
		1. Up to Spring 2009, antibodies (AP326F) were simply mixed with Au nanoparticles, but this produced unsatisfactory specificity
		2. Rob found Jen West's paper on immunolabeling with PEG; we adapted and began to use it (FA09--SP10)
	4.	Lack of specificity or stability; Ellis/Hoidn for pH and 5 kDa; NHS
		1. Unfortunately, the PEGylated spheres produced similarly dismal results. Therefore, over summer 2010, Perry Ellis and Oliver Hoidn investigated the system.
			1. pH and salt needed to be maintained
			2. our PEG-SH was too small to properly protect the gold, and especially necessary given the salts
			3. concerns about NHS
2. Creation of current protocol
	1. 5 kDa PEG-SH titration curve to find plateau at 50k PS/Au
	2. 5 kDa PEG-SH protection studies: monolayer (50k PS/Au) gives perfectly stable particles
	3. Modification of Ellis/Hoidn protocol to include 5 kDa PEG-SH
	4. Volume control (Alanna's pipette measurements) --- everything over 5 ÂµL
	5. Reference to Appendix containing protocol
3. DLS results with protocol
	1. AP124F results: proper increase with Ab, small increase from PS then hold steady
	2. AP124, MAB1999 results: note that they are puzzling; perhaps future work will bring clarity?
	3. In vitro binding studies go here, if we get to them?
4. Monolayer Labeling Study
5. 3D culture study
